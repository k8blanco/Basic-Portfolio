                <p>Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. 
                    Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. 
                    A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p><br>
                <p>Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. I thought today we would do a happy 
                    little picture. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it 
                    comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. </p><br>
                <p>All kinds of happy little splashes. Only eight colors that you need. It's important to me that you're happy. We have a fantastic little sky! Just let this 
                    happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.</p>
