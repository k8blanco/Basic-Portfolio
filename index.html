                <p>Katherine is relatively new to hands-on coding, though she's very familiar with it due to the simple fact that everyone she knows, including her husband, 
                    is in the industry in some capacity.  It therefore shouldn't be surprising that she's decided to pursue this path; rather, it should only be surprising 
                    in the respect that it's taken her this long.  Because Katherine also shows a decidedly robust streak of masochism, she enrolled herself in the University of Denver Fullstack
                    Coding Bootcamp and is currently devoting every free moment to coding and trying to come to an armistice with <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/yYSSBtDgbbRzq/giphy.gif" target="_blank">CSS</a>.  
                    She is greatly looking forward to Python and other backend languages, as they will agree with her far more than floating boxes - as necessary as those floating boxes may be.
                
                </p>In her previous life, Katherine was a marketer, advocate, educator, and overall Jane-of-all-trades with the major players in the gluten-free foods industry.  Her 
                    Bachelor's Degree is from the University of Colorado and is in Anthropology, which she has put to very good use so far...somehow.  In her prior career and previous jobs,
                    Katherine received many accolades and awards - none of which are applicable to her occupation now, but show that she is generally well-liked by everyone other than her toddler
                    at bedtime, and quite good at talking people into buying things they probably don't need.<br>
                <p></p>
                <p>In her <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/Z9OGuQyrfHAE8/giphy.gif" target="_blank">free time</a>, Katherine's hobbies are finding new hobbies.  Currently left unexplored are knitting, cross-stitch, 
                    llama-breeding, and, while she enjoys her fair share of physical activity, anything that requires moderate-to-normal coordination.  Katherine 
                    currently resides in beautiful Denver, CO, where she is sure she will take advantage of the skiing someday.  But probably not.</p><br>
